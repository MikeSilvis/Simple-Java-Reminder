Whitebox test - Unit test - Our whitebox unit test aims to validate the functionality of our login page. This makes sense for a unit test, as it aims to test no more than one class of a system. To carry out this test, we made use of the junit framework in order to test the input requirements of the login page, which requires a valid username and password. This test class utilizes the provided junit framework to iterate through multiple combinations of usernames and passwords. Only one combination of these login credentials was valid and we wanted to see the output generated by incorrect entries. Ant includes junit capabilities, but these were not utilized at this point. Instead, the class test.java was run in order to supply this login info. The test can be replicated by running this class in order to see the generated test output. Further updates will see this testing added to the ant build script.

Blackbox test - Regression test - Our blackbox test was selected in order to ensure that our code updates did not break functionality that already existed. This testing was highly iterative and conducted as updates to our system was added. To carry out this test, we continued to run and re-run our ant build script after updates to the system were made. Once we were sure the code successfully compiled and ran, we carry out further basic usability studies to ensure that users and existing capabilities were not negatively impacted by our additions. No practical way to incorporate these tests into our build script was found, although we are certainly open to feedback that could be used in later progress checks.
